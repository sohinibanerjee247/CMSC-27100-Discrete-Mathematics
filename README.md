# CMSC-27100-Discrete-Mathematics
This course emphasizes mathematical discovery and rigorous proof, which are illustrated on a refreshing variety of accessible and useful topics. Basic counting is a recurring theme and provides the most important source for sequences, which is another recurring theme. Further topics include proof by induction; recurrences and Fibonacci numbers; graph theory and trees; number theory, congruences, and Fermat's little theorem; counting, factorials, and binomial coefficients; combinatorial probability; random variables, expected value, and variance; and limits of sequences, asymptotic equality, and rates of growth.
